      How to make a Function in Python
    </h1>
    <a>
      In this tutorial we will discuss about the functions in python.
    </a>
    <h2>
      What are Functions ?
    </h2>
    <a>
      Function in Python is a set of code that performs a specific task. A functions runs when it is called. You can call a function multiple times. You can pass data into a function, known as Parameters. And a function can return the data. Functions help us to divide our programme into multiple tasks.
There are 2 types of functions:
1.	Built in Function : - print(), len(), input(), sorted(), etc.
2.	User defined functions: we can create according to programme.

    <h2>
      Creating a Function
    </h2>
    <a>
      In python, a function is defined using the def keyword.
>>>> def print_hello():
                print(“Hello from the function”)
In this example, we created a function which name is print_hello(). And its work is only print a statement. Now we have to call it after that this will print the statement. To call a function we have to write the name of the function like this.
>>>> print_hello()                                             # now this function will run.
    </a>
    <h2>
      Communication with Functions
    </h2>
    <a>
      We can communicate with the function by pass the values to it called parameters/arguments and the value returned from it. We can give multiple arguments to a function but it will return always one item. Now let’s see an example:
>>>> def add(x, y, z):
                  return x + y + z
In this function we create 3 variables to receive the value and returned the addition of the values. Now we will call this function by giving it 3 values otherwise this will show an error because the function is expecting 3 values.
>>>> sum = add(4,5,6)
>>>> print(sum)                                       # Output15
